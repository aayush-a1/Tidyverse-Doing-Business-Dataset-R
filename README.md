# Tidyverse-Doing-Business-Dataset-R
I worked on this project during my sophomore year for my Honors Business Technology &amp; Analysis class. The dataset is from the Doing Business survey over the years 2004 - 2018 conducted by the World Bank, which aims to assess the ease of doing business in different economies through measures such as the number of procedures required to start a business, the thoroughness of credit monitoring, the extent to which investors are protected, etc. I was given many problems to solve and graphs and tables to create using the Tidyverse library in the R programming language..
